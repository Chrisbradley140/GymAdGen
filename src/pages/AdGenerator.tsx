HOOK: [bold, clear statement - no questions]
PAIN MIRROR: [mirror a common struggle in inclusive terms]
BELIEF BREAKER: [short insight + differentiator/mechanism]
CTA: [direct, action-focused command]

TONE AND STYLE:
- Direct, confident, and benefit-focused. Avoid vague hype or exaggerated claims.
- Use simple, energetic language that matches the brand's voice: confident, conversational, and action-oriented.
- Start the HOOK with a statement, not a question. No rhetorical questions anywhere.

INCLUSIVITY AND META SAFETY:
- Do not reference personal attributes: age, gender, religion, ethnicity, health conditions, financial status, or relationship status.
- Use broad, inclusive descriptors instead (e.g., "busy professionals", "new parents", "time-pressed people").
- Avoid body shaming or negative self-perception. Focus on positive transformation, benefits, and empowerment.
- Keep outputs fully compliant with Meta ad policies and ready to use without further editing.

BRAND CONTEXT (use provided brand data and site scan to guide tone/USP/positioning):
- Voice & Tone: match their established communication style and brand words; avoid their blacklist.
- Align CTA with their specific offer.

OUTPUT RULES:
- Only return the four labeled sections in this order (no extra commentary).

You are a performance marketer. Create a 3-frame Instagram Story ad sequence for Meta that is inclusive, upbeat, and policy-safe.

Meta Safety Rules:
- Do not state or imply personal attributes (age, gender, health status, body type, physical condition, finances, relationship status).
- No numeric promises about weight, body fat, inches, percentages, or timelines.
- Replace "you" statements tied to a problem with inclusive, general observations (e.g., "Many people find cardio alone isn't enough").
- Remove age-specific references like "men over 30"; use broad descriptors instead (e.g., "busy professionals", "active people", "time-pressed people").
- Never suggest the viewer lacks consistency, energy, or success. Frame these as general challenges some people face.
- Avoid negative body image or shaming. Focus on positive, aspirational benefits (energy, confidence, consistency) without implying the audience currently lacks them.

Style:
- Short, visual, and upbeat; 1â€“2 sentences per frame.
- Never start with a question. No rhetorical/leading questions that imply a personal struggle (e.g., "Struggling...?", "Can't...?", "Tired of...?").
- Simple, energetic, conversational language that matches the brand's voice.
- Positive, inviting, and solution-focused.

Structure:
Frame 1: Bold hook as a general observation/trend (no "you"-problem framing, no questions)
Frame 2: Belief breaker + solution reveal in inclusive, aspirational terms
Frame 3: Clear CTA inviting action (no implication of deficiency)

Output format (exactly):
FRAME 1: [text]
FRAME 2: [text]
FRAME 3: [text]

Return only the three frames exactly in this format, no extra commentary.
